qemu-block-drivers \- QEMU block drivers reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
QEMU block driver reference manual
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Disk image file formats
.sp
QEMU supports many image file formats that can be used with VMs as well as with
any of the tools (like \fBqemu\-img\fP). This includes the preferred formats
raw and qcow2 as well as formats that are supported for compatibility with
older QEMU versions or other hypervisors.
.sp
Depending on the image format, different options can be passed to
\fBqemu\-img create\fP and \fBqemu\-img convert\fP using the \fB\-o\fP option.
This section describes each format and the options that are supported for it.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B raw
Raw disk image format. This format has the advantage of
being simple and easily exportable to all other emulators. If your
file system supports \fIholes\fP (for example in ext2 or ext3 on
Linux or NTFS on Windows), then only the written sectors will reserve
space. Use \fBqemu\-img info\fP to know the real size used by the
image or \fBls \-ls\fP on Unix/Linux.
.sp
Supported options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B preallocation
Preallocation mode (allowed values: \fBoff\fP, \fBfalloc\fP,
\fBfull\fP). \fBfalloc\fP mode preallocates space for image by
calling \fBposix_fallocate()\fP\&. \fBfull\fP mode preallocates space
for image by writing data to underlying storage. This data may or
may not be zero, depending on the storage location.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B qcow2
QEMU image format, the most versatile format. Use it to have smaller
images (useful if your filesystem does not supports holes, for example
on Windows), zlib based compression and support of multiple VM
snapshots.
.sp
Supported options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B compat
Determines the qcow2 version to use. \fBcompat=0.10\fP uses the
traditional image format that can be read by any QEMU since 0.10.
\fBcompat=1.1\fP enables image format extensions that only QEMU 1.1 and
newer understand (this is the default). Amongst others, this includes
zero clusters, which allow efficient copy\-on\-read for sparse images.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B backing_file
File name of a base image (see \fBcreate\fP subcommand)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B backing_fmt
Image format of the base image
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encryption
This option is deprecated and equivalent to \fBencrypt.format=aes\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.format
If this is set to \fBluks\fP, it requests that the qcow2 payload (not
qcow2 header) be encrypted using the LUKS format. The passphrase to
use to unlock the LUKS key slot is given by the \fBencrypt.key\-secret\fP
parameter. LUKS encryption parameters can be tuned with the other
\fBencrypt.*\fP parameters.
.sp
If this is set to \fBaes\fP, the image is encrypted with 128\-bit AES\-CBC.
The encryption key is given by the \fBencrypt.key\-secret\fP parameter.
This encryption format is considered to be flawed by modern cryptography
standards, suffering from a number of design problems:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
The AES\-CBC cipher is used with predictable initialization vectors based
on the sector number. This makes it vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks
which can reveal the existence of encrypted data.
.IP \(bu 2
The user passphrase is directly used as the encryption key. A poorly
chosen or short passphrase will compromise the security of the encryption.
.IP \(bu 2
In the event of the passphrase being compromised there is no way to
change the passphrase to protect data in any qcow images. The files must
be cloned, using a different encryption passphrase in the new file. The
original file must then be securely erased using a program like shred,
though even this is ineffective with many modern storage technologies.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The use of this is no longer supported in system emulators. Support only
remains in the command line utilities, for the purposes of data liberation
and interoperability with old versions of QEMU. The \fBluks\fP format
should be used instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.key\-secret
Provides the ID of a \fBsecret\fP object that contains the passphrase
(\fBencrypt.format=luks\fP) or encryption key (\fBencrypt.format=aes\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.cipher\-alg
Name of the cipher algorithm and key length. Currently defaults
to \fBaes\-256\fP\&. Only used when \fBencrypt.format=luks\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.cipher\-mode
Name of the encryption mode to use. Currently defaults to \fBxts\fP\&.
Only used when \fBencrypt.format=luks\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.ivgen\-alg
Name of the initialization vector generator algorithm. Currently defaults
to \fBplain64\fP\&. Only used when \fBencrypt.format=luks\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.ivgen\-hash\-alg
Name of the hash algorithm to use with the initialization vector generator
(if required). Defaults to \fBsha256\fP\&. Only used when \fBencrypt.format=luks\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.hash\-alg
Name of the hash algorithm to use for PBKDF algorithm
Defaults to \fBsha256\fP\&. Only used when \fBencrypt.format=luks\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B encrypt.iter\-time
Amount of time, in milliseconds, to use for PBKDF algorithm per key slot.
Defaults to \fB2000\fP\&. Only used when \fBencrypt.format=luks\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B cluster_size
Changes the qcow2 cluster size (must be between 512 and 2M). Smaller cluster
sizes can improve the image file size whereas larger cluster sizes generally
provide better performance.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B preallocation
Preallocation mode (allowed values: \fBoff\fP, \fBmetadata\fP, \fBfalloc\fP,
\fBfull\fP). An image with preallocated metadata is initially larger but can
improve performance when the image needs to grow. \fBfalloc\fP and \fBfull\fP
preallocations are like the same options of \fBraw\fP format, but sets up
metadata also.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B lazy_refcounts
If this option is set to \fBon\fP, reference count updates are postponed with
the goal of avoiding metadata I/O and improving performance. This is
particularly interesting with \fBcache=writethrough\fP which doesn\(aqt batch
metadata updates. The tradeoff is that after a host crash, the reference count
tables must be rebuilt, i.e. on the next open an (automatic) \fBqemu\-img
check \-r all\fP is required, which may take some time.
.sp
This option can only be enabled if \fBcompat=1.1\fP is specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B nocow
If this option is set to \fBon\fP, it will turn off COW of the file. It\(aqs only
valid on btrfs, no effect on other file systems.
.sp
Btrfs has low performance when hosting a VM image file, even more
when the guest on the VM also using btrfs as file system. Turning off
COW is a way to mitigate this bad performance. Generally there are two
ways to turn off COW on btrfs:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Disable it by mounting with nodatacow, then all newly created files
will be NOCOW.
.IP \(bu 2
For an empty file, add the NOCOW file attribute. That\(aqs what this
option does.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: this option is only valid to new or empty files. If there is
an existing file which is COW and has data blocks already, it couldn\(aqt
be changed to NOCOW by setting \fBnocow=on\fP\&. One can issue \fBlsattr
filename\fP to check if the NOCOW flag is set or not (Capital \(aqC\(aq is
NOCOW flag).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B qed
Old QEMU image format with support for backing files and compact image files
(when your filesystem or transport medium does not support holes).
.sp
When converting QED images to qcow2, you might want to consider using the
\fBlazy_refcounts=on\fP option to get a more QED\-like behaviour.
.sp
Supported options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B backing_file
File name of a base image (see \fBcreate\fP subcommand).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B backing_fmt
Image file format of backing file (optional).  Useful if the format cannot be
autodetected because it has no header, like some vhd/vpc files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B cluster_size
Changes the cluster size (must be power\-of\-2 between 4K and 64K). Smaller
cluster sizes can improve the image file size whereas larger cluster sizes
generally provide better performance.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B table_size
Changes the number of clusters per L1/L2 table (must be
power\-of\-2 between 1 and 16).  There is normally no need to
change this value but this option can between used for
performance benchmarking.

The encryption key is given by the \fBencrypt.key\-secret\fP parameter.
This encryption format is considered to be flawed by modern cryptography
standards, suffering from a number of design problems enumerated previously
against the \fBqcow2\fP image format.
.sp
The use of this is no longer supported in system emulators. Support only
remains in the command line utilities, for the purposes of data liberation

.SS Using host drives
.sp
In addition to disk image files, QEMU can directly access host
devices. We describe here the usage for QEMU version >= 0.8.3.
.SS Linux
.sp
On Linux, you can directly use the host device filename instead of a
disk image filename provided you have enough privileges to access
it. For example, use \fB/dev/cdrom\fP to access to the CDROM.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CD
You can specify a CDROM device even if no CDROM is loaded. QEMU has
specific code to detect CDROM insertion or removal. CDROM ejection by
the guest OS is supported. Currently only data CDs are supported.
.TP
.B Floppy
You can specify a floppy device even if no floppy is loaded. Floppy
removal is currently not detected accurately (if you change floppy
without doing floppy access while the floppy is not loaded, the guest
OS will think that the same floppy is loaded).
Use of the host\(aqs floppy device is deprecated, and support for it will
be removed in a future release.
.TP
.B Hard disks
Hard disks can be used. Normally you must specify the whole disk
(\fB/dev/hdb\fP instead of \fB/dev/hdb1\fP) so that the guest OS can
see it as a partitioned disk. WARNING: unless you know what you do, it
is better to only make READ\-ONLY accesses to the hard disk otherwise
you may corrupt your host data (use the \fB\-snapshot\fP command
line option or modify the device permissions accordingly).
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CD
The preferred syntax is the drive letter (e.g. \fBd:\fP). The
alternate syntax \fB\e\e.\ed:\fP is supported. \fB/dev/cdrom\fP is
supported as an alias to the first CDROM drive.
.sp
Currently there is no specific code to handle removable media, so it
is better to use the \fBchange\fP or \fBeject\fP monitor commands to
change or eject media.
.TP
.B Hard disks
Hard disks can be used with the syntax: \fB\e\e.\ePhysicalDriveN\fP
where \fIN\fP is the drive number (0 is the first hard disk).
.sp
WARNING: unless you know what you do, it is better to only make
READ\-ONLY accesses to the hard disk otherwise you may corrupt your
host data (use the \fB\-snapshot\fP command line so that the
modifications are written in a temporary file).
.UNINDENT
.SS Mac OS X
.sp
\fB/dev/cdrom\fP is an alias to the first CDROM.
.sp
Currently there is no specific code to handle removable media, so it
is better to use the \fBchange\fP or \fBeject\fP monitor commands to
change or eject media.
.SS Virtual FAT disk images
.sp
QEMU can automatically create a virtual FAT disk image from a
directory tree. In order to use it, just type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux.img \-hdb fat:/my_directory
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then you access access to all the files in the \fB/my_directory\fP
directory without having to copy them in a disk image or to export
them via SAMBA or NFS. The default access is \fIread\-only\fP\&.
.sp
Floppies can be emulated with the \fB:floppy:\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux.img \-fda fat:floppy:/my_directory
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A read/write support is available for testing (beta stage) with the
\fB:rw:\fP option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux.img \-fda fat:floppy:rw:/my_directory

What you should \fInever\fP do:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
use non\-ASCII filenames
.IP \(bu 2
use "\-snapshot" together with ":rw:"
.IP \(bu 2
expect it to work when loadvm\(aqing
.IP \(bu 2
write to the FAT directory on the host system while accessing it with the guest system
.UNINDENT
.SS NBD access
.sp
QEMU can access directly to block device exported using the Network Block Device
protocol.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux.img \-hdb nbd://my_nbd_server.mydomain.org:1024/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the NBD server is located on the same host, you can use an unix socket instead
of an inet socket:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux.img \-hdb nbd+unix://?socket=/tmp/my_socket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, the block device must be exported using \fBqemu\-nbd\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-nbd \-\-socket=/tmp/my_socket my_disk.qcow2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The use of \fBqemu\-nbd\fP allows sharing of a disk between several guests:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-nbd \-\-socket=/tmp/my_socket \-\-share=2 my_disk.qcow2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and then you can use it with two guests:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux1.img \-hdb nbd+unix://?socket=/tmp/my_socket
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux2.img \-hdb nbd+unix://?socket=/tmp/my_socket
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the \fBnbd\-server\fP uses named exports (supported since NBD 2.9.18, or with QEMU\(aqs
own embedded NBD server), you must specify an export name in the URI:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 \-cdrom nbd://localhost/debian\-500\-ppc\-netinst
qemu\-system\-x86_64 \-cdrom nbd://localhost/openSUSE\-11.1\-ppc\-netinst
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The URI syntax for NBD is supported since QEMU 1.3.  An alternative syntax is
also available.  Here are some example of the older syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qemu\-system\-x86_64 linux.img \-hdb nbd:my_nbd_server.mydomain.org:1024

.SS iSCSI LUNs
.sp
iSCSI is a popular protocol used to access SCSI devices across a computer
network.
.sp
There are two different ways iSCSI devices can be used by QEMU.
.sp
The first method is to mount the iSCSI LUN on the host, and make it appear as
any other ordinary SCSI device on the host and then to access this device as a
/dev/sd device from QEMU. How to do this differs between host OSes.
.sp
The second method involves using the iSCSI initiator that is built into
QEMU. This provides a mechanism that works the same way regardless of which
host OS you are running QEMU on. This section will describe this second method
of using iSCSI together with QEMU.
.sp
In QEMU, iSCSI devices are described using special iSCSI URLs. URL syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
iscsi://[<username>[%<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/<target\-iqn\-name>/<lun>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Username and password are optional and only used if your target is set up
using CHAP authentication for access control.
Alternatively the username and password can also be set via environment
variables to have these not show up in the process list:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export LIBISCSI_CHAP_USERNAME=<username>
export LIBISCSI_CHAP_PASSWORD=<password>
iscsi://<host>/<target\-iqn\-name>/<lun>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Various session related parameters can be set via special options, either
in a configuration file provided via \(aq\-readconfig\(aq or directly on the
command line.
.sp
If the initiator\-name is not specified qemu will use a default name
of \(aqiqn.2008\-11.org.linux\-kvm[:<uuid>\(aq] where <uuid> is the UUID of the
virtual machine. If the UUID is not specified qemu will use
\(aqiqn.2008\-11.org.linux\-kvm[:<name>\(aq] where <name> is the name of the
virtual machine.

\fIgluster\fP is the protocol.
.sp
\fITYPE\fP specifies the transport type used to connect to gluster
management daemon (glusterd). Valid transport types are
tcp and unix. In the URI form, if a transport type isn\(aqt specified,
then tcp type is assumed.
.sp
\fIHOST\fP specifies the server where the volume file specification for
the given volume resides. This can be either a hostname or an ipv4 address.
If transport type is unix, then \fIHOST\fP field should not be specified.
Instead \fIsocket\fP field needs to be populated with the path to unix domain
socket.
.sp
\fIPORT\fP is the port number on which glusterd is listening. This is optional
and if not specified, it defaults to port 24007. If the transport type is unix,
then \fIPORT\fP should not be specified.
.sp
\fIVOLUME\fP is the name of the gluster volume which contains the disk image.
.sp
\fIPATH\fP is the path to the actual disk image that resides on gluster volume.
.sp
\fIdebug\fP is the logging level of the gluster protocol driver. Debug levels
are 0\-9, with 9 being the most verbose, and 0 representing no debugging output.
The default level is 4. The current logging levels defined in the gluster source
are 0 \- None, 1 \- Emergency, 2 \- Alert, 3 \- Critical, 4 \- Error, 5 \- Warning,
6 \- Notice, 7 \- Info, 8 \- Debug, 9 \- Trace
.sp
\fIlogfile\fP is a commandline option to mention log file path which helps in
logging to the specified file and also help in persisting the gfapi logs. The
default is stderr.

The optional \fIHOST_KEY_CHECK\fP parameter controls how the remote
host\(aqs key is checked.  The default is \fByes\fP which means to use
the local \fB\&.ssh/known_hosts\fP file.  Setting this to \fBno\fP
turns off known\-hosts checking.  Or you can check that the host key
matches a specific fingerprint. The fingerprint can be provided in
\fBmd5\fP, \fBsha1\fP, or \fBsha256\fP format, however, it is strongly
recommended to only use \fBsha256\fP, since the other options are
considered insecure by modern standards. The fingerprint value
must be given as a hex encoded string:
.INDENT 0.0

Note that there can be multiple keys present per host, each with
different key ciphers. Care is needed to pick the key fingerprint
that matches the cipher QEMU will negotiate with the remote server.
.sp
Currently authentication must be done using ssh\-agent.  Other
authentication methods may be supported in future.
.sp
Note: Many ssh servers do not support an \fBfsync\fP\-style operation.
The ssh driver cannot guarantee that disk flush requests are
obeyed, and this causes a risk of disk corruption if the remote
server or network goes down during writes.  The driver will
print a warning when \fBfsync\fP is not supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS NVMe disk images
.sp
NVM Express (NVMe) storage controllers can be accessed directly by a userspace
driver in QEMU.  This bypasses the host kernel file system and block layers
while retaining QEMU block layer functionalities, such as block jobs, I/O
throttling, image formats, etc.  Disk I/O performance is typically higher than
with \fB\-drive file=/dev/sda\fP using either thread pool or linux\-aio.
.sp
The controller will be exclusively used by the QEMU process once started. To be
able to share storage between multiple VMs and other applications on the host,
please use the file based protocols.
.sp
Before starting QEMU, bind the host NVMe controller to the host vfio\-pci
driver.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# modprobe vfio\-pci
# lspci \-n \-s 0000:06:0d.0

# echo 0000:06:0d.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:06:0d.0/driver/unbind

.SS Disk image file locking
.sp
By default, QEMU tries to protect image files from unexpected concurrent
access, as long as it\(aqs supported by the block protocol driver and host
operating system. If multiple QEMU processes (including QEMU emulators and
utilities) try to open the same image with conflicting accessing modes, all but
the first one will get an error.
.sp
This feature is currently supported by the file protocol on Linux with the Open
File Descriptor (OFD) locking API, and can be configured to fall back to POSIX
locking if the POSIX host doesn\(aqt support Linux OFD locking.
.sp
To explicitly enable image locking, specify "locking=on" in the file protocol
driver options. If OFD locking is not possible, a warning will be printed and
the POSIX locking API will be used. In this case there is a risk that the lock
will get silently lost when doing hot plugging and block jobs, due to the
shortcomings of the POSIX locking API.
.sp
QEMU transparently handles lock handover during shared storage migration.  For
shared virtual disk images between multiple VMs, the "share\-rw" device option
should be used.
.sp
By default, the guest has exclusive write access to its disk image. If the
guest can safely share the disk image with other writers the
\fB\-device ...,share\-rw=on\fP parameter can be used.  This is only safe if
the guest is running software, such as a cluster file system, that
coordinates disk accesses to avoid corruption.
.sp
Note that share\-rw=on only declares the guest\(aqs ability to share the disk.
Some QEMU features, such as image file formats, require exclusive write access
to the disk image and this is unaffected by the share\-rw=on option.
.sp
Alternatively, locking can be fully disabled by "locking=off" block device
option. In the command line, the option is usually in the form of
"file.locking=off" as the protocol driver is normally placed as a "file" child
under a format driver. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-blockdev driver=qcow2,file.filename=/path/to/image,file.locking=off,file.driver=file
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To check if image locking is active, check the output of the "lslocks" command
on host and see if there are locks held by the QEMU process on the image file.
More than one byte could be locked by the QEMU instance, each byte of which
reflects a particular permission that is acquired or protected by the running
block driver.
.SS Filter drivers
.sp
QEMU supports several filter drivers, which don\(aqt store any data, but perform
some additional tasks, hooking io requests.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B preallocate
The preallocate filter driver is intended to be inserted between format
and protocol nodes and preallocates some additional space
(expanding the protocol file) when writing past the file’s end. This can be
useful for file\-systems with slow allocation.
.sp
Supported options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B prealloc\-align
On preallocation, align the file length to this value (in bytes), default 1M.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B prealloc\-size
How much to preallocate (in bytes), default 128M.
