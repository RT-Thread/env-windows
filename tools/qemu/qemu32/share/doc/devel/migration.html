<h1>Migration<a class="headerlink" href="#migration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>QEMU has code to load/save the state of the guest that it is running.
These are two complementary operations.  Saving the state just does
that, saves the state for each device that the guest is running.
Restoring a guest is just the opposite operation: we need to load the
state of each device.</p>
<p>For this to work, QEMU has to be launched with the same arguments the
two times.  I.e. it can only restore the state in one guest that has
the same devices that the one it was saved (this last requirement can
be relaxed a bit, but for now we can consider that configuration has
to be exactly the same).</p>
<p>Once that we are able to save/restore a guest, a new functionality is
requested: migration.  This means that QEMU is able to start in one
machine and being “migrated” to another machine.  I.e. being moved to
another machine.</p>
<p>Next was the “live migration” functionality.  This is important
because some guests run with a lot of state (specially RAM), and it
can take a while to move all state from one machine to another.  Live
migration allows the guest to continue running while the state is
transferred.  Only while the last part of the state is transferred has
the guest to be stopped.  Typically the time that the guest is
unresponsive during live migration is the low hundred of milliseconds
(notice that this depends on a lot of things).</p>
<section id="transports">
<h2>Transports<a class="headerlink" href="#transports" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The migration stream is normally just a byte stream that can be passed
over any transport.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>tcp migration: do the migration using tcp sockets</p></li>
<li><p>unix migration: do the migration using unix sockets</p></li>
<li><p>exec migration: do the migration using the stdin/stdout through a process.</p></li>
<li><p>fd migration: do the migration using a file descriptor that is
passed to QEMU.  QEMU doesn’t care how this file descriptor is opened.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, support is included for migration using RDMA, which
transports the page data using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RDMA</span></code>, where the hardware takes care of
transporting the pages, and the load on the CPU is much lower.  While the
internals of RDMA migration are a bit different, this isn’t really visible
outside the RAM migration code.</p>
<p>All these migration protocols use the same infrastructure to
save/restore state devices.  This infrastructure is shared with the
savevm/loadvm functionality.</p>

<section id="debugging">
<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>

<h2>Common infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#common-infrastructure" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>

the  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QEMUFile</span></code> type (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">migration/qemu-file.h</span></code>).  In most cases this

<section id="saving-the-state-of-one-device">
<h2>Saving the state of one device<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-the-state-of-one-device" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For most devices, the state is saved in a single call to the migration
infrastructure; these are <em>non-iterative</em> devices.  The data for these
devices is sent at the end of precopy migration, when the CPUs are paused.
There are also <em>iterative</em> devices, which contain a very large amount of
data (e.g. RAM or large tables).  See the iterative device section below.</p>
<section id="general-advice-for-device-developers">
<h3>General advice for device developers<a class="headerlink" href="#general-advice-for-device-developers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The migration state saved should reflect the device being modelled rather
than the way your implementation works.  That way if you change the implementation
later the migration stream will stay compatible.  That model may include
internal state that’s not directly visible in a register.</p></li>
<li><p>When saving a migration stream the device code may walk and check
the state of the device.  These checks might fail in various ways (e.g.
discovering internal state is corrupt or that the guest has done something bad).
Consider carefully before asserting/aborting at this point, since the
normal response from users is that <em>migration broke their VM</em> since it had
apparently been running fine until then.  In these error cases, the device
should log a message indicating the cause of error, and should consider
putting the device into an error state, allowing the rest of the VM to
continue execution.</p></li>
<li><p>The migration might happen at an inconvenient point,
e.g. right in the middle of the guest reprogramming the device, during
guest reboot or shutdown or while the device is waiting for external IO.
It’s strongly preferred that migrations do not fail in this situation,
since in the cloud environment migrations might happen automatically to
VMs that the administrator doesn’t directly control.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do need to fail a migration, ensure that sufficient information
is logged to identify what went wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>The destination should treat an incoming migration stream as hostile
(which we do to varying degrees in the existing code).  Check that offsets
into buffers and the like can’t cause overruns.  Fail the incoming migration
in the case of a corrupted stream like this.</p></li>
<li><p>Take care with internal device state or behaviour that might become
migration version dependent.  For example, the order of PCI capabilities
is required to stay constant across migration.  Another example would
be that a special case handled by subsections (see below) might become
much more common if a default behaviour is changed.</p></li>
<li><p>The state of the source should not be changed or destroyed by the
outgoing migration.  Migrations timing out or being failed by
higher levels of management, or failures of the destination host are
not unusual, and in that case the VM is restarted on the source.
Note that the management layer can validly revert the migration
even though the QEMU level of migration has succeeded as long as it
does it before starting execution on the destination.</p></li>
<li><p>Buses and devices should be able to explicitly specify addresses when
instantiated, and management tools should use those.  For example,
when hot adding USB devices it’s important to specify the ports
and addresses, since implicit ordering based on the command line order
may be different on the destination.  This can result in the
device state being loaded into the wrong device.</p></li>

<p>We are declaring the state with name “pckbd”.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">version_id</span></code> is 3, and the fields are 4 uint8_t in a KBDState structure.
We registered this with:</p>

</div>
<p>For devices that are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qdev</span></code> based, we can register the device in the class

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The VMState macros take care of ensuring that the device data section
is formatted portably (normally big endian) and make some compile time checks
against the types of the fields in the structures.</p>
<p>VMState macros can include other VMStateDescriptions to store substructures
(see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VMSTATE_STRUCT_</span></code>), arrays (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VMSTATE_ARRAY_</span></code>) and variable length
arrays (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VMSTATE_VARRAY_</span></code>).  Various other macros exist for special
cases.</p>
<p>Note that the format on the wire is still very raw; i.e. a VMSTATE_UINT32
ends up with a 4 byte bigendian representation on the wire; in the future
it might be possible to use a more structured format.</p>

<p>This way is going to disappear as soon as all current users are ported to VMSTATE;

<p>Two functions in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ops</span></code> structure are the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_state</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_state</span></code> functions.  Notice that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_state</span></code> receives a version_id
parameter to know what state format is receiving.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_state</span></code> doesn’t
have a version_id parameter because it always uses the latest version.</p>
<p>Note that because the VMState macros still save the data in a raw

<section id="changing-migration-data-structures">
<h3>Changing migration data structures<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-migration-data-structures" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When we migrate a device, we save/load the state as a series
of fields.  Sometimes, due to bugs or new functionality, we need to
change the state to store more/different information.  Changing the migration
state saved for a device can break migration compatibility unless
care is taken to use the appropriate techniques.  In general QEMU tries
to maintain forward migration compatibility (i.e. migrating from
QEMU n-&gt;n+1) and there are users who benefit from backward compatibility
as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="subsections">
<h3>Subsections<a class="headerlink" href="#subsections" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The most common structure change is adding new data, e.g. when adding
a newer form of device, or adding that state that you previously
forgot to migrate.  This is best solved using a subsection.</p>
<p>A subsection is “like” a device vmstate, but with a particularity, it
has a Boolean function that tells if that values are needed to be sent
or not.  If this functions returns false, the subsection is not sent.
Subsections have a unique name, that is looked for on the receiving
side.</p>
<p>On the receiving side, if we found a subsection for a device that we
don’t understand, we just fail the migration.  If we understand all
the subsections, then we load the state with success.  There’s no check
that a subsection is loaded, so a newer QEMU that knows about a subsection
can (with care) load a stream from an older QEMU that didn’t send
the subsection.</p>
<p>If the new data is only needed in a rare case, then the subsection
can be made conditional on that case and the migration will still
succeed to older QEMUs in most cases.  This is OK for data that’s
critical, but in some use cases it’s preferred that the migration
should succeed even with the data missing.  To support this the
subsection can be connected to a device property and from there
to a versioned machine type.</p>
<p>The ‘pre_load’ and ‘post_load’ functions on subsections are only
called if the subsection is loaded.</p>
<p>One important note is that the outer post_load() function is called “after”
loading all subsections, because a newer subsection could change the same
value that it uses.  A flag, and the combination of outer pre_load and

<p>Here we have a subsection for the pio state.  We only need to
save/send this state when we are in the middle of a pio operation
(that is what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ide_drive_pio_state_needed()</span></code> checks).  If DRQ_STAT is
not enabled, the values on that fields are garbage and don’t need to
be sent.</p>

<section id="connecting-subsections-to-properties">
<h3>Connecting subsections to properties<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-subsections-to-properties" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Using a condition function that checks a ‘property’ to determine whether
to send a subsection allows backward migration compatibility when
new subsections are added, especially when combined with versioned
machine types.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Add a new property using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DEFINE_PROP_BOOL</span></code> - e.g. support-foo and
default it to true.</p></li>
<li><p>Add an entry to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hw_compat_</span></code> for the previous version that sets
the property to false.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a static bool  support_foo function that tests the property.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a subsection with a .needed set to the support_foo function</p></li>
<li><p>(potentially) Add an outer pre_load that sets up a default value
for ‘foo’ to be used if the subsection isn’t loaded.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now that subsection will not be generated when using an older
machine type and the migration stream will be accepted by older
QEMU versions.</p>
</section>
<section id="not-sending-existing-elements">
<h3>Not sending existing elements<a class="headerlink" href="#not-sending-existing-elements" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes members of the VMState are no longer needed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>removing them will break migration compatibility</p></li>
<li><p>making them version dependent and bumping the version will break backward migration
compatibility.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Adding a dummy field into the migration stream is normally the best way to preserve
compatibility.</p>
<p>If the field really does need to be removed then:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Add a new property/compatibility/function in the same way for subsections above.</p></li>
<li><p>replace the VMSTATE macro with the _TEST version of the macro, e.g.:</p></li>
</ol>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VMSTATE_UINT32_TEST(foo,</span> <span class="pre">barstruct,</span> <span class="pre">pre_version_baz)</span></code></p>
<p>Sometime in the future when we no longer care about the ancient versions these can be killed off.
Note that for backward compatibility it’s important to fill in the structure with
data that the destination will understand.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Any difference in the predicates on the source and destination will end up
with different fields being enabled and data being loaded into the wrong
fields; for this reason conditional fields like this are very fragile.</p>
</section>
<section id="versions">
<h3>Versions<a class="headerlink" href="#versions" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Version numbers are intended for major incompatible changes to the
migration of a device, and using them breaks backward-migration
compatibility; in general most changes can be made by adding Subsections
(see above) or _TEST macros (see above) which won’t break compatibility.</p>
<p>Each version is associated with a series of fields saved.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_state</span></code> always saves
the state as the newer version.  But <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_state</span></code> sometimes is able to
load state from an older version.</p>
<p>You can see that there are two version fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">version_id</span></code>: the maximum version_id supported by VMState for that device.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minimum_version_id</span></code>: the minimum version_id that VMState is able to understand
for that device.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>VMState is able to read versions from minimum_version_id to version_id.</p>
<p>There are <em>_V</em> forms of many <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VMSTATE_</span></code> macros to load fields for version dependent fields,
e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">VMSTATE_UINT16_V</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ip_id</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Slirp</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>only loads that field for versions 2 and newer.</p>
<p>Saving state will always create a section with the ‘version_id’ value
and thus can’t be loaded by any older QEMU.</p>
</section>
<section id="massaging-functions">
<h3>Massaging functions<a class="headerlink" href="#massaging-functions" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, it is not enough to be able to save the state directly
from one structure, we need to fill the correct values there.  One
example is when we are using kvm.  Before saving the cpu state, we
need to ask kvm to copy to QEMU the state that it is using.  And the
opposite when we are loading the state, we need a way to tell kvm to
load the state for the cpu that we have just loaded from the QEMUFile.</p>
<p>The functions to do that are inside a vmstate definition, and are called:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">(*pre_load)(void</span> <span class="pre">*opaque);</span></code></p>
<p>This function is called before we load the state of one device.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">(*post_load)(void</span> <span class="pre">*opaque,</span> <span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">version_id);</span></code></p>
<p>This function is called after we load the state of one device.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">(*pre_save)(void</span> <span class="pre">*opaque);</span></code></p>
<p>This function is called before we save the state of one device.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">(*post_save)(void</span> <span class="pre">*opaque);</span></code></p>
<p>This function is called after we save the state of one device
(even upon failure, unless the call to pre_save returned an error).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: You can look at hpet.c, that uses the first three functions
to massage the state that is transferred.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VMSTATE_WITH_TMP</span></code> macro may be useful when the migration
data doesn’t match the stored device data well; it allows an
intermediate temporary structure to be populated with migration
data and then transferred to the main structure.</p>
<p>If you use memory API functions that update memory layout outside
initialization (i.e., in response to a guest action), this is a strong
indication that you need to call these functions in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">post_load</span></code> callback.
Examples of such memory API functions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>memory_region_add_subregion()</p></li>
<li><p>memory_region_del_subregion()</p></li>
<li><p>memory_region_set_readonly()</p></li>
<li><p>memory_region_set_nonvolatile()</p></li>
<li><p>memory_region_set_enabled()</p></li>
<li><p>memory_region_set_address()</p></li>
<li><p>memory_region_set_alias_offset()</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="iterative-device-migration">
<h3>Iterative device migration<a class="headerlink" href="#iterative-device-migration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Some devices, such as RAM, Block storage or certain platform devices,
have large amounts of data that would mean that the CPUs would be
paused for too long if they were sent in one section.  For these
devices an <em>iterative</em> approach is taken.</p>
<p>The iterative devices generally don’t use VMState macros
(although it may be possible in some cases) and instead use
qemu_put_*/qemu_get_* macros to read/write data to the stream.  Specialist
versions exist for high bandwidth IO.</p>
<p>An iterative device must provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_setup</span></code> function that initialises the data structures and
transmits a first section containing information on the device.  In the
case of RAM this transmits a list of RAMBlocks and sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_setup</span></code> function that initialises the data structures on the
destination.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_live_pending</span></code> function that is called repeatedly and must
indicate how much more data the iterative data must save.  The core
migration code will use this to determine when to pause the CPUs
and complete the migration.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_live_iterate</span></code> function (called after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_live_pending</span></code>
when there is significant data still to be sent).  It should send
a chunk of data until the point that stream bandwidth limits tell it
to stop.  Each call generates one section.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_live_complete_precopy</span></code> function that must transmit the
last section for the device containing any remaining data.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">load_state</span></code> function used to load sections generated by
any of the save functions that generate sections.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cleanup</span></code> functions for both save and load that are called
at the end of migration.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that the contents of the sections for iterative migration tend
to be open-coded by the devices; care should be taken in parsing
the results and structuring the stream to make them easy to validate.</p>
</section>
<section id="device-ordering">
<h3>Device ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#device-ordering" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are cases in which the ordering of device loading matters; for
example in some systems where a device may assert an interrupt during loading,
if the interrupt controller is loaded later then it might lose the state.</p>
<p>Some ordering is implicitly provided by the order in which the machine
definition creates devices, however this is somewhat fragile.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MigrationPriority</span></code> enum provides a means of explicitly enforcing
ordering.  Numerically higher priorities are loaded earlier.
The priority is set by setting the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">priority</span></code> field of the top level

by the code described above.  For non-iterative devices they have a single
section; iterative devices have an initial and last section and a set
of parts in between.
Note that there is very little checking by the common code of the integrity
of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">device</span> <span class="pre">data</span></code> contents, that’s up to the devices themselves.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">footer</span> <span class="pre">mark</span></code> provides a little bit of protection for the case where
the receiving side reads more or less data than expected.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ID</span> <span class="pre">string</span></code> is normally unique, having been formed from a bus name
and device address, PCI devices and storage devices hung off PCI controllers
fit this pattern well.  Some devices are fixed single instances (e.g. “pc-ram”).
Others (especially either older devices or system devices which for

<h2>Postcopy<a class="headerlink" href="#postcopy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>‘Postcopy’ migration is a way to deal with migrations that refuse to converge
(or take too long to converge) its plus side is that there is an upper bound on
the amount of migration traffic and time it takes, the down side is that during
the postcopy phase, a failure of <em>either</em> side or the network connection causes
the guest to be lost.</p>
<p>In postcopy the destination CPUs are started before all the memory has been
transferred, and accesses to pages that are yet to be transferred cause
a fault that’s translated by QEMU into a request to the source QEMU.</p>
<p>Postcopy can be combined with precopy (i.e. normal migration) so that if precopy
doesn’t finish in a given time the switch is made to postcopy.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">migrate_set_capability</span> <span class="pre">postcopy-ram</span> <span class="pre">on</span></code></p>
<p>The normal commands are then used to start a migration, which is still
started in precopy mode.  Issuing:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">migrate_start_postcopy</span></code></p>
<p>will now cause the transition from precopy to postcopy.
It can be issued immediately after migration is started or any
time later on.  Issuing it after the end of a migration is harmless.</p>
<p>Blocktime is a postcopy live migration metric, intended to show how
long the vCPU was in state of interruptible sleep due to pagefault.
That metric is calculated both for all vCPUs as overlapped value, and
separately for each vCPU. These values are calculated on destination
side.  To enable postcopy blocktime calculation, enter following
command on destination monitor:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">migrate_set_capability</span> <span class="pre">postcopy-blocktime</span> <span class="pre">on</span></code></p>
<p>Postcopy blocktime can be retrieved by query-migrate qmp command.
postcopy-blocktime value of qmp command will show overlapped blocking
time for all vCPU, postcopy-vcpu-blocktime will show list of blocking
time per vCPU.</p>

<section id="postcopy-device-transfer">
<h3>Postcopy device transfer<a class="headerlink" href="#postcopy-device-transfer" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Loading of device data may cause the device emulation to access guest RAM
that may trigger faults that have to be resolved by the source, as such
the migration stream has to be able to respond with page data <em>during</em> the
device load, and hence the device data has to be read from the stream completely
before the device load begins to free the stream up.  This is achieved by
‘packaging’ the device data into a blob that’s read in one go.</p>
</section>
<section id="source-behaviour">
<h3>Source behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#source-behaviour" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Until postcopy is entered the migration stream is identical to normal
precopy, except for the addition of a ‘postcopy advise’ command at
the beginning, to tell the destination that postcopy might happen.
When postcopy starts the source sends the page discard data and then
forms the ‘package’ containing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>Command: ‘postcopy listen’</p></li>
<li><p>The device state</p>
<p>A series of sections, identical to the precopy streams device state stream
containing everything except postcopiable devices (i.e. RAM)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Command: ‘postcopy run’</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The ‘package’ is sent as the data part of a Command: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMD_PACKAGED</span></code>, and the
contents are formatted in the same way as the main migration stream.</p>
<p>During postcopy the source scans the list of dirty pages and sends them
to the destination without being requested (in much the same way as precopy),
however when a page request is received from the destination, the dirty page
scanning restarts from the requested location.  This causes requested pages
to be sent quickly, and also causes pages directly after the requested page
to be sent quickly in the hope that those pages are likely to be used
by the destination soon.</p>
</section>
<section id="destination-behaviour">
<h3>Destination behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#destination-behaviour" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Initially the destination looks the same as precopy, with a single thread
reading the migration stream; the ‘postcopy advise’ and ‘discard’ commands
are processed to change the way RAM is managed, but don’t affect the stream
processing.</p>

<section id="source-side-page-maps">
<h3>Source side page maps<a class="headerlink" href="#source-side-page-maps" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The source side keeps two bitmaps during postcopy; ‘the migration bitmap’
and ‘unsent map’.  The ‘migration bitmap’ is basically the same as in
the precopy case, and holds a bit to indicate that page is ‘dirty’ -
i.e. needs sending.  During the precopy phase this is updated as the CPU
dirties pages, however during postcopy the CPUs are stopped and nothing
should dirty anything any more.</p>
<p>The ‘unsent map’ is used for the transition to postcopy. It is a bitmap that
has a bit cleared whenever a page is sent to the destination, however during
the transition to postcopy mode it is combined with the migration bitmap
to form a set of pages that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Have been sent but then redirtied (which must be discarded)</p></li>
<li><p>Have not yet been sent - which also must be discarded to cause any
transparent huge pages built during precopy to be broken.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that the contents of the unsentmap are sacrificed during the calculation
of the discard set and thus aren’t valid once in postcopy.  The dirtymap
is still valid and is used to ensure that no page is sent more than once.  Any
request for a page that has already been sent is ignored.  Duplicate requests
such as this can happen as a page is sent at about the same time the
destination accesses it.</p>

<h3>Postcopy with hugepages<a class="headerlink" href="#postcopy-with-hugepages" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>

<li><p>The linux kernel on the destination must support userfault on hugepages.</p></li>
<li><p>The huge-page configuration on the source and destination VMs must be
identical; i.e. RAMBlocks on both sides must use the same page size.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-mem-path</span> <span class="pre">/dev/hugepages</span></code>  will fall back to allocating normal

Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-mem-prealloc</span></code> enforces the allocation using hugepages.</p></li>
<li><p>Care should be taken with the size of hugepage used; postcopy with 2MB
hugepages works well, however 1GB hugepages are likely to be problematic
since it takes ~1 second to transfer a 1GB hugepage across a 10Gbps link,

<section id="postcopy-with-shared-memory">
<h3>Postcopy with shared memory<a class="headerlink" href="#postcopy-with-shared-memory" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Postcopy migration with shared memory needs explicit support from the other
processes that share memory and from QEMU. There are restrictions on the type of
memory that userfault can support shared.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel userfault support works on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/shm</span></code> memory and on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hugetlbfs</span></code>
(although the kernel doesn’t provide an equivalent to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)</span></code>
for hugetlbfs which may be a problem in some configurations).</p>
<p>The vhost-user code in QEMU supports clients that have Postcopy support,
and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vhost-user-bridge</span></code> (in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tests/</span></code>) and the DPDK package have changes
to support postcopy.</p>
<p>The client needs to open a userfaultfd and register the areas
of memory that it maps with userfault.  The client must then pass the
userfaultfd back to QEMU together with a mapping table that allows
fault addresses in the clients address space to be converted back to
RAMBlock/offsets.  The client’s userfaultfd is added to the postcopy
fault-thread and page requests are made on behalf of the client by QEMU.
QEMU performs ‘wake’ operations on the client’s userfaultfd to allow it
to continue after a page has arrived.</p>

<h2>Firmware<a class="headerlink" href="#firmware" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Migration migrates the copies of RAM and ROM, and thus when running
on the destination it includes the firmware from the source. Even after
resetting a VM, the old firmware is used.  Only once QEMU has been restarted
is the new firmware in use.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Changes in firmware size can cause changes in the required RAMBlock size
to hold the firmware and thus migration can fail.  In practice it’s best
to pad firmware images to convenient powers of 2 with plenty of space
for growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Care should be taken with device emulation code so that newer
emulation code can work with older firmware to allow forward migration.</p></li>
<li><p>Care should be taken with newer firmware so that backward migration
to older systems with older device emulation code will work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases it may be best to tie specific firmware versions to specific
versioned machine types to cut down on the combinations that will need
support.  This is also useful when newer versions of firmware outgrow
the padding.</p>
